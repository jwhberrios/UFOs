# UFOs

## Overview of Project
#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find UFO sighting information based on the following criteria: city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting presented in an interactive table where the user can pull specific results by inputting the details in the search criteria boxes.

#### Results
With the UFO sightings data connected to the main webpage to search, the website (Figure 1), which consists of an interactive table, will display search results after the website visitor inputs specific search criteria on the left side of the website (Figure 2).

#### Summary
The website is a good start with sifting through UFO sighting data linked to the website. However, there is a limitation to this setup in that the data is limited to the database used, which is limited to the year 2010 and in the United States.
One recommendation to address this limitation is to expand the UFO sighting data to multiple years within the U.S and in other countries as well.
A second recommendation is to make the search criteria more focused by perhaps offering options in the search rather than leaving it open to the user to type in the details. This will maximize the likelihood of printing search results onto the table.
